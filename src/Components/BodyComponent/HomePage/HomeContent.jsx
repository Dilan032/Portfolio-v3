    <h1 className="fw-bold">Hi, I'm Dilan Kanishka | Software Engineer in Sri Lanka </h1>
    <p>From Puttalam District, Sri Lanka</p>
    <p>
      I am an IT undergraduate from SLIATE, having completed the Higher National Diploma in Information Technology (HNDIT). 
      As an entry-level developer, I am passionate about continuous learning and staying up-to-date with emerging technologies in the IT industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      During my 6-month internship as a Trainee Software Engineer, I gained hands-on experience in full-stack development. Before starting the internship, I was only familiar with Laravel. At the request of my supervisor, I learned Node.js and worked closely with front-end developers to develop APIs. I also started learning React.js to expand my front-end development skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eager to gain more real-world experience, I am committed to contributing to innovative digital solutions, building efficient, user-friendly applications, and continuously improving my technical and problem-solving abilities.
